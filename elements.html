						</style>
						<ul>
							<li>Version Conttrol </li>
							<li>Database setup in MySQL Workbench</li>
							<li>Set up the MySQL instance server in MySQL Workbench</li>
							<li>Creating an Entity Relationship Model in MySQL Workbench</li>
							<li>Create an ER diagram data model and implement it in MySQL</li>
							<li>Use SQL to create virtual tables, stored procedures and prepared statements for Little
								Lemon restaurant
							</li>

							<li>stablisheding a database API that allows Python code to interact with a database
							<li> Add query functions
							<li>Using Tableau to help Little Lemon generate insights using the tools data analysis
								features
						</ul>

							Version control is an indispensable component of software development and collaborative
							projects. It encompasses the management of modifications made to a project's source code and
							related files throughout its lifespan.

							In this project, I fulfilled the following tasks:

							<style>
								ol {
									margin-left: 20px;
								}
							</style>

						<ol>
							<li>Establishment of a repository or local directory, serving as a centralized location for
								code storage.</li>
							<li>Thorough documentation and tracking of all system modifications implemented.</li>
							<li>Provision of collaborative access, granting others the ability to review, contribute to,
								and enhance the codebase.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Little Lemon, a growing business, recognized the need for a reliable relational database
							system to efficiently store and manage large amounts of data. As part of this project, I
							successfully implemented the use of MySQL Workbench to create a robust database system for
							Little Lemon.
						<p>
							<hr />

						</p> As part of the database system development for Little Lemon, I created an Entity
						Relationship (ER) diagram to represent the structure and relationships within their database.
						The ER diagram serves as a visual representation of entities, attributes, and the connections
						between them.

						During the database design phase, I explored various data models, including the Entity
						Relationship Model, Hierarchical Data Model, Object-Oriented Data Model, and Dimensional Data
						Model. Each model offers unique advantages and considerations, tailored to specific objectives.
						</p>
						</p>The following illustration provides an ER diagram of the physical data model for Little
						Lemon, which has been deployed in MySQL. </p>

						<img src="LittleLemonDM.png" alt="Description of the image" />
						<hr />
						</p>After creating the physical model, I proceeded to perform the following steps: synchronizing
						it with the MySQL server using the forward-engineer method. To accomplish this, I launched the
						Forward Engineer. The wizard generated the
						internal SQL schema, which was executed in MySQL Workbench. </p>

						<hr />
						</p>Little Lemon asked to create a virtual table called OrdersView that focuses on OrderID,
						Quantity and Cost with orders quantity of more than 2.</p>
						<h3>Query</h3>

						<pre><code>CREATE VIEW OrdersView AS
SELECT OrderID, Quantity, Cost
FROM orders
WHERE Quantity > 2;

</code></pre>

					<hr />
					</p>LLittle Lemon asked to create a procedure called GetMaxQuantity() that displays the maximum
					ordered quantity in the orders table.</p>
					<h3>Query</h3>

					<pre><code>SELECT customers.CustomerID, customers.FullName, orders.OrderID, orders.Cost, menus.MenuName, menuitems.CourseName
FROM customers INNER JOIN orders 
ON customers.CustomerID = orders.customerID
INNER JOIN menus ON orders.MenuID = menus.MenuID 
INNER JOIN menuitems ON menuitems.MenuItemID = menus.MenuItemsID WHERE Cost > 150  ORDER BY Cost;</code></pre>
					<hr />
					</p>Little Lemon asked you to create a procedure called GetMaxQuantity() that displays the maximum
					ordered quantity in the orders table.</p>
					<h3>Query</h3>

					<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE 'GetMaxQuantity'()
SELECT max(quantity) AS "Max Quantity in Order" FROM orders

</code></pre>
					<hr />
					</p>Little Lemon asked to create few procedures to complete the following tasks:

					<li>Make a booking using a procedure called MakeBooking(),


					<li>Check a booking using a procedure called CheckBooking(),


					<li>Cancel booking using a procedure called CancelBooking(),


					<li>and update booking using a procedure called UpdateBooking().

						</p>
						<h3>MakeBooking() query</h3>

						<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE 'MakeBooking'(booking_id INT, customer_id INT, table_no int, booking_date date)
BEGIN
INSERT INTO bookings (BookingID, BookingDate, TableNumber, CustomerID) VALUES 
(booking_id, booking_date, table_no, customer_id);
SELECT "New booking added" AS "Confirmation";
END

</code></pre>
						<h3>CheckBooking() query

						</h3>

						<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE 'CheckBooking'(booking_date DATE, table_number INT)
BEGIN
DECLARE bookedTable INT DEFAULT 0;
 SELECT COUNT(bookedTable)
	INTO bookedTable
	FROM Bookings WHERE BookingDate = booking_date and TableNumber = table_number;
	IF bookedTable > 0 THEN
	  SELECT CONCAT( "Table", table_number, "is already booked") AS "Booking status";
	  ELSE 
	  SELECT CONCAT( "Table", table_number, "is not booked") AS "Booking status";
	END IF;
END

						<h3>CancelBooking() query

						</h3>

						<pre><code>
CREATE PROCEDURE CancelBooking(IN bookingId INT)
BEGIN

    DELETE FROM Bookings WHERE BookingID= bookingId; 

END

						</p>The next steps were to visualize the sales data of a restaurant and implement a database
						client in
						Python. This step aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:

					<li>Data visualization: Utilizing appropriate tools and techniques to represent the restaurant's
						sales data in a visual format.

					<li>Complete implementation: Developing a database client using Python to interact with the
						restaurant's database, allowing for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis </p>

						Conclusion</p>

						After exploring data visualization with Tableau, we have gained valuable insights through visual
						representations. The use of Tableau's powerful tools has allowed me to uncover meaningful
						patterns and trends in the data.

						</p>It has been a journey of discovery and understanding. Thank you
						for joining me on this exploration and for engaging with the project. If you have any further
						questions or thoughts, please feel free to share. With the enhanced visual insights gained, we
						conclude this project. Thank you once again for your participation.
